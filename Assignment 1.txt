1. Write a program that takes two numbers as innput and prints their sum.

PROGRAM Sum:

READ Number1;
READ Number2;
PRINT Number1+Number2;

END.

2. Write a program that prints all even numbers frotn 1 to 100.

PROGRAM PrintEven1to100:

Start = 1;
WHILE(Start<=100):
DO IF(Start MOD 2 == 0):
THEN PRINT Start + ",";
Start += 1;
ENDIF;
ENDWHILE;

END.

3. Write a function that checks if a given year is a leap year or not.

PROGRAM CheckLeapYear:

READ InputYear;
IF(InputYear MOD 4 == 0):
THEN PRINT InputYear + " is a Leap Year!";
ELSE PRINT InputYear + " is not a Leap Year!";
ENDIF

END.

4. Write a program that converts kilometers per hours to miles per hour. Hint: 1km = 0.621371

PROGRAM ConvertKMPHtoMPH:

READ Speed;
PRINT "Original Speed in KMPH: " + Speed;
PRINT "Converted Speed in MPH: " + Speed*0.621371;

END.

5. Write a pseudocode to check whether a number is a buzz number or not. Hint: A number is said to be buzz if it is divisible by 7 or if it ends with 7.

PROGRAM CheckBuzzNumber:

READ BuzzNumber;
IF(BuzzNumber MOD 7 == 0 OR BuzzNumber MOD 10 == 7)
THEN PRINT BuzzNumber + " is a Buzz Number!";
ELSE PRINT BuzzNumber + " is not a Buzz Number!";
ENDIF

END.

6. Write a program that asks a user for number and prints the multiplication table of that number up to 10.

PROGRAM NumberTable:

READ Number;
FOR(I = 0 to 10, STEP = 1):
	PRINT Number + " X " I + " = " + Number*I
ENDFOR;

END.

7. Write a program that computes the factorial of a number (n').

PROGRAM Factorial:

READ Number;
Result = 2;
WHILE(Number >= 3):
DO Total *= Number;
Number -= 1;
ENDWHILE;

END.

8. Write a function that checks whether a number is prime or not.

PROGRAM CheckPrime:

READ Number;
Limit = 2;
IsPrime = TRUE;
WHILE(Limit <= Number/2):
DO IF(Number MOD Limit == 0):
		THEN IsPrime = FALSE;
		Break;
	Limit +=1
ENDWHILE;
IF(IsPrime):
THEN PRINT Number + " is a Prime Number!";
ELSE PRINT Number + " is not a Prime Number!";
ENDIF;

END.

9. Write a program to check whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene triangle.
	In a scalene triangle, all the sides of a triangle are of different length.
	In an isosceles triangle, two sides of a triangle are of the same measure.
	In an equilateral triangle, all the sides of a triangle are of equal length.

PROGRAM IdentifyTriangle:

READ SIDE1;
READ SIDE2;
READ SIDE3;
IF(SIDE1 == SIDE2 AND SIDE1 == SIDE3):
	THEN PRINT "It is an Equilateral Triangle!";
	ELSE IF(SIDE1 == SIDE2 OR SIDE2==SIDE3 OR SIDE1==SIDE3):
		THEN PRINT "It is an Isosceles Triangle!";
		ELSE PRINT "It is an Scalene Triangle!";
	ENDIF
ENDIF

END.

10. Print this pattern: (using multiple prints and then by loop)

*
**
***
****
*****

PROGRAM PrintPatterm:

PRINT "*";
PRINT "**";
PRINT "***";
PRINT "****";
PRINT "*****";

FOR(I = 1 to 5, STEP = 1):
	FOR(J = 1 to I, STEP = J):
		PRINT_INLINE "*";
	ENDFOR;
	PRINT ""
ENDFOR;

END.

BONUS. Write a function that checks whether a number is a palindrome or not.

PROGRAM CheckPalindrome:

READ Number;
Reverse = 0;
NumberCopy = Number;
WHILE(NumberCopy != 0):
DO Reverse = Reverse * 10 + (NumberCopy MOD 10);
NumberCopy /= 10;
ENDWHILE;
IF(Reverse == Number):
THEN PRINT Number + " is a Palindrome!";
ELSE PRINT Number + " is not a Palindrome!";
ENDIF;

END.
