You prefer to internalize your growth alot in the aspect that when observing people you tend to internalize them and than reflec tback upon yourselves. This at times limit your creativity and at points may also limit you reasoning.

Your priamry mindset is not let yourself left behind or rather more precisely left out but at the same time you worry a bit about being precived as an outcast

You have a tendency of chipping away at who you really are to accustom yourself with groups or new people you meet, This can feel suffocative to you at times. You also worry about if you should share about your inner self with people or not.

You tend to delve in secrecy of your personality beliving to be taht a good trait for you yet you are somone who doesnt really relish or thrive in that loneliness.
